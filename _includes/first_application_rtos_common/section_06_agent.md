### Olimex STM32-E407 Serial connection

Olimex development board is connected to the computer using the usb to serial cable:

***TIP:** Color codes are applicable to [this cable](https://www.olimex.com/Products/Components/Cables/USB-Serial-Cable/USB-Serial-Cable-F/). Make sure to match Olimex Rx with Cable Tx and vice-versa. Remember GND!*

### Olimex STM32-E407 USB connection

Olimex development board is connected to the computer using the USB OTG 2 connector (the miniUSB connector that is furthest from the Ethernet port).

Then run the agent:

```bash
# Run a micro-ROS agent
ros2 run micro_ros_agent micro_ros_agent serial --dev [device]
```

***TIP:** you can use this command to find your serial device name: `ls /dev/serial/by-id/*`*

## Test the sample micro-ROS app behaviour

Once the micro-ROS app is built and flashed, and the board is connected to a micro-ROS agent, let's check that everything is working in a new command line. 
We are going to listen to ping topic to check whether the Ping Pong node is publishing its own ping messages:

```bash
source /opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/setup.bash

# Subscribe to micro-ROS ping topic
ros2 topic echo /microROS/ping
```

You should see the topic messages published by the Ping Pong node every 5 seconds:

```
user@user:~$ ros2 topic echo /microROS/ping
stamp:
  sec: 20
  nanosec: 867000000
frame_id: '1344887256_1085377743'
---
stamp:
  sec: 25
  nanosec: 942000000
frame_id: '730417256_1085377743'
---
```

On another command line, let's subscribe to the pong topic

```bash
source /opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/setup.bash

# Subscribe to micro-ROS pong topic
ros2 topic echo /microROS/pong
```

At this point, we know that our app is publishing pings. Let's check if it also answers to someone else pings in a new command line:

```bash
source /opt/ros/$ROS_DISTRO/setup.bash

# Send a fake ping
ros2 topic pub --once /microROS/ping std_msgs/msg/Header '{frame_id: "fake_ping"}'
```

Now, we should see on the ping subscriber our fake ping along with the board pings:

```
user@user:~$ ros2 topic echo /microROS/ping
stamp:
  sec: 0
  nanosec: 0
frame_id: fake_ping
---
stamp:
  sec: 305
  nanosec: 973000000
frame_id: '451230256_1085377743'
---
stamp:
  sec: 310
  nanosec: 957000000
frame_id: '2084670932_1085377743'
---
```

And in the pong subscriber, we should see the board's answer to our fake ping:

```
user@user:~$ ros2 topic echo /microROS/pong
stamp:
  sec: 0
  nanosec: 0
frame_id: fake_ping
---
```
