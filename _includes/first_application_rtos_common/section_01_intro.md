After you have completed the [First micro-ROS application on Linux tutorial](../../first_application_linux), you are now ready to flash a microcontroller with this application based on a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). Micro-ROS currently supports three different RTOS, namely NuttX, FreeRTOS, and Zephyr.

To follow this tutorial, it is assumed that the user is already familiar with the **[First micro-ROS Application on an RTOS](https://micro-ros.github.io/docs/tutorials/core/first_application_rtos/)** tutorial. The target app in this tutorial is the same ping pong app. Another requirement is that the user has a basic knowledge of micro-ROS and ROS 2.
